hello I will do a demo of tankinventory report and movement report 

first go to tankinventory report 
this sprint added the graphQl API of tankinventory report.  and integration it. we can see the report data is real data, and same as aura model.

and then go to movement report page,in this page also is real data from  backend api.

in this grid the column include material, movement,  state, template, plannedvolume, plannedTargetVolume, averageFlowrate,  source , destination... and other properties.
and there is a time range filter. by default it was empyt. then retrurn all of the movement, 
if we set the starttime, it will return the movement after that time.
if we set the end time, it will return the movement before that time.
if we set both of them, it will return the movement between them.

and we can click this x button to clear time range.  then will show all of  the movements
