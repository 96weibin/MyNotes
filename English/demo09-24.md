HI I will demo the name, title update of product, and create snapshot dialog update.

in the home page you can see. the create product tooltip, "Create a AUM Product"

and then click create aum model, you can see the labels "AUM data server", "AUM database"

after create open the model detail panel, you can see the detail tab, "AUM data server", "AUM database" and value.

there is a small issue here. there is no aura model info return. so that aura info is empty.

and then open Aum Model.

duraing opening. you can see the browser title, and url still are "OMM", that need backend to fix it.

when open this model, icon title also updated "Aspen Unified Movements"

and then create a sanpshot. you can see there is a data range selector rather than two rows datetime picker.

there is a small issue here. our date rage picker can't select a time of day. is that ok?

after created you can see the snapshot extension name is .aumz

then back to home page. click import snapshot. the massage update to please select a aumz...

then click browser yuo can see the .aumz snapshot is here, select it to import it.

import is successful.

here is a small issue. before BDD still use the .ommz snapshot, so should I update bdd step and snapshot extention name?
