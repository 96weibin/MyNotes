hello everyone 
I'm weibin, I will do a quick demo of integration trend API of OMM

First I already create an Aura model, there are some unit and maped difrently tagdata.

we can go to the data acquisition page. the reference Object is maped.

and I created a OMM model with this aura

go to the all tanks page. 

after the user selected a tank then the trend display.

and user can select many tanks. then will disply many trend combain

and there are a drop down will display the tagName.

and the tooltip, show or hide and time line is same as aura.

go to the movements page

I created selvel movement with diferent source and destination

the select a movement 001 there is to resource then there is two trend and two drop down here.

and we can select mutipl movement like this.

and user can modify the source of destionation. 

then we can see the trend is updated.


there are still some problom 

there is no config api of trend. so the trend setting will not be seave.
and the time range
