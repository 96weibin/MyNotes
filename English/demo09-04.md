Hi I will demo snapshot with start end time and manual cutoff

there is a Aum model, we can see the general setting, use refinery demo v1, go to tank page.
we can see there are some tanks. we can create snapshot on abar button.

we can see the create snapshot dialog, there are start and end time, by default end time is current time, start time is 5 days before.

set a name and then click create. then we can see the snapshot download was successful.

go to home page we also can click three dot of AUM model then click create model snapshot, 

type a name click create. the snapshot download was succeful.

we can import this snapshot type new name, then import was succesful
open the model we can see the tank page general setting, is same as base aum model.


then I will demo manual cutoff, the manual cutoff is a temporary design.

there is a plus drop down on the grid top right. open dropdown, create cutoff button


if there is no tank selected then click 'creat cutoff' then will creat cutoff of all tanks.
then the successful toast pop up

go to movement page.

there is a same button on the grid top right.
